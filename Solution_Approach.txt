TITLE : PRODUCT_LENGTH Prediction

OBJECTIVE : To preprocess textual data, engineer features, and develop a predictive model for PRODUCT_LENGTH.

APPROACH :

	* Examined dataset and identified missing values and anomalies
	* Divided the data set into two parts and pre-processed it separately
	* Applied log transformation on PRODUCT_LENGTH attribute to reduce skewness
	* Filled null values with an empty string
	* Removed punctuations, stopwords, html tags, and lemmatized text data
	* Tried both bag_of_words and Tfidf methods for vectorizing text data
	* Created a new attribute named data which consists all the text data
	* Used XGBoost algorithm for modelling due to its ensembling learning method

RESULTS :

	* Normalizing the attribute scaled the values between 1 to 10
	* Filling null values with an empty string was not ideal but worked
	* XGBoost performed best among tree-based algorithms for predicting PRODUCT_LENGTH

LIMITATIONS :

	* Using an empty string to fill null values may have introduced noise in the data
